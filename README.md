### Welcome to CardDex!

CardDex is an app that stores a database of pokemon cards for you to look up and find out any information about the card you need to know.
This app is perfect for the average Pokemon player and even for collectors of Pokemon cards too!

This app stores the Pokemon card sets by the format they are in, which is respectively Standard, Expanded, and Unlimited. You can choose which format you would like to browse for sets then the app will ask you which set you would like to explore for the card you are looking for. After choosing a set, the app will then display a list of the cards in that set in chronological order allowing you to choose a specific card. Once you choose a card, the app will display a list of all the information about that card. It will also ask you if you would like to return to the main menu if you choose to look up another card.

Some of the information CardDex shows you are as follows:
* Shows you the card name with the set number
* Gives you the text or flavor text of the card
* Tells you all the attacks and/or abilities of the card
* Shows the Weakness, Resistance, and Retreat cost of the card
* Displays what type of card it is (Pokemon, Trainer, Energy, etc.)
